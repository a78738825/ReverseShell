# Simple Shell Implementation in Python

This project demonstrates a simple shell implementation using the Python `socket` module. It's designed to showcase how to create a basic command execution environment that communicates over a network. This example can serve as a foundation for more complex applications like remote administration tools or educational projects to understand network programming and shell interactions.

## Features

- **Basic Command Execution**: Execute commands on the server from the client side.
- **Network Communication**: Utilizes Python's `socket` module for network communication.
- **Simple Architecture**: Easy to understand and extend for educational purposes or specific use cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on both server and client machines.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to both the server and client machines:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a78738825/ReverseShell.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd ReverseShell
   ```

### Usage

1. **Server Setup**: On the server machine, run the server script:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   This will start the server and wait for connections from clients.

2. **Client Connection**: On the client machine, run the client script with the server's IP address and port:
   ```bash
   python client.py <server_ip_address> <server port>
   ```
   Replace `<server_ip_address>` and `<server port>` with the actual IP address and port of the server.

3. Once connected, you can type commands into the client shell, and the output will be displayed back to you from the server.
